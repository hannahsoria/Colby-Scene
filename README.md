# Colby Scene: Lorimer Chapel

I created a shape library called shape.lib so I could write all the definitions for my shape functions then call them directly to main.py. This is done so the amount of coding in main.py is minimal. In shape.lib I created simple shapes that would be the building blocks of the drawing. Then I created compound shapes by making functions combining two shapes that stay coherent with scale changes. Next I started importing those shapes into main.py with specific coordinates and scales to create a picture of the Lorimer Chapel. Next I added colors to the shapes and added borders of the shapes. When colby1 is run it depicts Lorimer Chapel in color and three dimensionally.
